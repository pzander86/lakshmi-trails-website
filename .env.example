# Environment Variables for Lakshmi Trails

# Email Service Configuration (Required for contact form)
# Get your API key from: https://resend.com/
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Note: This is a server-only variable and will NOT be exposed to the client
# Server-only variables in Astro are accessed via import.meta.env.VARIABLE_NAME
# and are only available in server-side code (API routes, server components)

# Public variables (if needed) should be prefixed with PUBLIC_
# Example: PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://lakshmitrails.com
# These would be available in client-side code, so never put secrets here!
